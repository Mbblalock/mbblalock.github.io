# About Me
## Things I Like
I enjoy shooting pool and being outdoors. I have been playing pool competetively for about 5 years and I like to go hiking and running. I am pursuing a degree in cloud infrastructure and I spent 11 years in the military. I was infantry in the USMC.
## My Website
[Bleacher Report](www.bleacherreport.com) - I get all my sports information from here. Specifically the Panthers and the Braves.  
[YouTube](www.youtube.com) - I watch alot of tutorials shooting pool here to learn things. Also, a good place for learning to do about anything.
